## Getting Started üöÄ

### Prerequisites

To run the Swing-based Ludo Game, you need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Swing library (usually included with JDK)

### Installation üì•

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tomer00/Ludo-Java.git
   ```
2. **Setting Assets:** Inside [Utils.java](https://github.com/tomer00/Ludo-Java/blob/master/src/Utils.java) file change {your-project-directory} with actual location of project directory.
3. **Compile and Run:** Open this project in Intellij and Run [Ludo.java](src/Ludo.java).

## Gameplay üéÆ

To play the Ludo game, players take turns rolling the dice by clicking on the "Dice icon". The number rolled on the dice determines how many spaces a player's token can move. Players can only move their own tokens and must try to get all of their tokens to reach the centre of the board.


## Cheat Feature ü§´

For mischievous players, we've included a special cheat feature that allows you to manipulate the dice roll. Before rolling the dice, press a specific number key (e.g., 1 to 6) to get the desired dice number. Use this feature wisely to gain an advantage over your opponents, but remember, cheaters never prosper for long! 

To access the cheat feature, simply press the desired number key before rolling the dice. This can be a fun way to spice up the game and add an element of surprise. However, it's important to use this feature responsibly and not abuse it, as it may take away from the fair competition and enjoyment of the game. Remember, playing with integrity is always more rewarding in the long run!
